This is the start of my OS repository! 
I will upload as much as I can, and I'm planning to make it open-source once I get all the foundational stuff in.
I'm not sure what liscensing I have to use as of now, and I mean no harm if there is anything that is that is known as copywright or plagiarism. Please contact me through: sincerely.aisha1.0@gmail.com or through GitHub to let me know. When all the foundational stuff is done, I'll start on liscensing.
Feel free to make add-ons and stuff here
I'm planning on making this an everything kind of os, from quantum stuff (hopefully! I'm working under a quantum computer research scientist in my free time as of now) to everyday use, and adding a couple games in between. 

Have fun exploring this repo!
