This is the start of my OS repository! 
I will upload as much as I can, and I'm planning to make it open-source once I get all the foundational stuff in.
I'm not sure what liscensing I have to use as of now, and I mean no harm if there is anything that is that is known as copywright or plagiarism. Please contact me through GitHub. When all the foundational stuff is done, I'll start on liscensing.
Feel free to make add-ons and stuff here
I'm planning on making this an everything kind of os, from quantum stuff (hopefully! I'm working under a quantum computer research scientist in my free time as of now) to everyday use, and adding a couple games in between. I would also like to make this OS actually look good, considering the whole reason I made this OS was 1. because I completed the final boss on Doom nightmare mode, and 2. Windows 11 looks horrendous and needs severe customization and because my dramatic self said "why not make your own OS that looks good?" so here I am! (yes I know linux is made to be aesthetically pleasing but I already started and I have to finish it) 

My computer specs: I'm using a samsung laptop I got for sale, I forgot which model, but I'll update when I find it. 

CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 10510U 

Im using Ubuntu through WSL, and I am making this whole OS through Windows 11.

Regardless,

Have fun exploring this repo!
